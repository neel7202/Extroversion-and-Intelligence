# Extroversion-and-Intelligence
The goal of this project was to investigate the relationship between personality and intelligence. I decided to use extroversion and risk aversion as two separate metrics to measure personality and SAT scores and GPAs to measure intelligence.

In every data visualization, extroverts had higher average intelligence than introverts and risk-averse members had higher average intelligence than risk-lovers. However, in the end, I found no significant relationship between personality and intelligence.

There were a few shortcomings to my data analysis. For one, intelligence is very difficult to measure. SAT scores and GPA are not only measuring intelligence, but also test-taking ability, attention span, and does not account for personal differences such as access to resources and time availability. As a result, GPA and SAT scores may not be to most accurate metric for intelligence.

Moreover, personality types were self-reported in this study. Each person’s idea of extroversion and risk-aversion is different, and a result the data is not completely objective. Also, in order to make oneself seem better, respondents may have inflated their SAT and GPA scores. This could potentially bias the data.

I do think the results could have been different if I had a larger, more representative sample. I believe this to be the case because Emory University is a very selective university that already selects for high GPAs and proven grade getters. Regardless if an accepted student is an extrovert or introvert, they are very likely to have strong academic backgrounds. Because of this, if I were able to take a simple random sample of the population of the United States, I believe the results could have been different. It is possible that there is a significant relationship between personality and intelligence, but everyone at the amazing school of Emory University is only attended by geniuses and so personality seems to have no effect.

If I had to do the project again, I would…

Control for family income: This would make my metrics of intelligence (SAT scores and GPA) measure intelligence to a greater degree. Wealthier families have access to greater school districts, SAT prep books, and greater connections. As a result, controlling for wealth by creating different groups would allow for a more accurate measure of intelligence.

Have a better scale to measure extroversion: While answering the survey myself, I found it extremely difficult to identify with either being an introvert or extrovert. As a result, for that specific question, I would create a scale from 1 - 10 asking how extroverted the respondent is with 1 being ‘extremely introverted’ and 10 being ‘extremely extroverted’. This would allow for a more precise metric of personality.

Send this survey to a more representative sample: At least to different classes to fully represent Emory outside of the Econ 220 Lab class. There are many more demographics at Emory besides the mathematically inclined Economics students such as art, music, or life science majors, and even athletes. Currently, I have the suspicion that most people in ECON 220 were strong academic students. If possible, I would like to reach out to other colleges in Georgia where test scores and GPAs are lower on average. This may allow me to see a relationship between personality and intelligence more clearly if it exists.
